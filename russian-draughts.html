<p>Russian draughts are the traditional and most popular type of checkers in Russia, the countries of the former USSR and in Israel. The goal of the game is to deprive the opponent of the possibility of a move by taking or locking all of his pieces (in the reverse Russian draughts, the goal is opposite &#8211; to deprive oneself of the possibility of a move).</p>
<h2>Distinctive Russian draughts features:</h2>
<ul>
<li>draughts go only in the dark color squares.</li>
<li>The board is positioned so that the corner field at the bottom left of the player’s side is dark.</li>
<li>A simple piece strikes forward and back, the queen walks and hits on any diagonal field.</li>
<li>During a fight, a simple piece can turn into a queen and immediately continue the fight according to the rules of the queen.</li>
<li>If there are several options for the fight, you can choose any of them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>History of draughts</h2>
<h3>Russian Empire</h3>
<p>The game of draughts is known for a long time. So in 1551, Metropolitan Daniel declared the games of chess and checkers as vicious as foul language and drunkenness, which was enshrined in the decisions of the Stoglav Cathedral, which was held in Moscow this year with the participation of Ivan the Terrible. However, in 1649, the ban on chess and checkers games was abolished by Patriarch Nikon in the code of laws “ Cathedral Code ”.</p>
<p>At the time of Peter the Great, drafts were part of the program of the assemblies. However, until the XIX century, there were no single checkers rules, it did not allow to hold competitions. It was decided before the party to stipulate the conditions for its conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>rate (what can be read from Nikolai Gogol in the poem « Dead Souls »<br />
&#8211; Well, listen, we will play draughts, win &#8211; your all. After all, I have many of those who need to be deleted from the revision. Hey, Porfiry, bring a piece of paper here.<br />
&#8211; Vain labor, I will not play.<br />
“But this is not a bank; there can be no happiness or falsehood: everything is from art; I even anticipate you that I do not know how to play at all unless you give me something ahead.<br />
“Seven, I,” Chichikov thought to himself, “play checkers with him!” I played not badly in draughts, and it’s hard for him to get up on things here. ”<br />
&#8211; If you please, so be it, I&rsquo;ll play checkers.<br />
&#8211; Souls go in a hundred rubles!<br />
&#8211; Why? rather, if they go to fifty.<br />
&#8211; No, what&rsquo;s the big score fifty? Well, I’d better include some medium-sized puppy or golden signet to the watch for this amount.<br />
&#8211; Well, if you please! &#8211; said Chichikov.</li>
<li>identifying the weakest player and determining the odds for him (a draw is equal to the victory of the weakest, the weakest can go first two moves, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8211; How much will you give me ahead? &#8211; said Nozdrev.<br />
&#8211; This is why on earth? Of course, nothing.<br />
&#8211; At least let it be my two moves.<br />
&#8211; I do not want, I myself play badly.<br />
&#8211; We know you as you play badly! &#8211; said Nozdrev, speaking with a sword.<br />
&#8211; I haven&rsquo;t taken draughts for a long time! &#8211; said Chichikov, moving the sword too.</p>
<p>the nature of the allowed moves (could be limited to the course of the lady, the rule of the fuk of serious players was not specified &#8211; they played without fuki).<br />
It was considered particularly shameful to get locked checkers.</p>
<p>In 1803, Nikolai Mikhailovich Karamzin, a writer, and historian, published in the journal “ Vestnik Evropy ” the first article in Russia about drafts called “New Drafts Game”.</p>
<p>In 1827, in St. Petersburg, the first book about draughts in Russian was published, “ A Guide to Thorough Knowledge of a Drafts Game, or The Art of Beating Everyone into Simple Drafts, ” written by chess master and drafts player Alexander Dmitrievich Petrov.</p>
<p>In the period from 1859 to 1863, the Chess Sheet magazine (edited by V. Mikhailov) was published in St. Petersburg, where from 1861 there was a section dedicated to drafts, which published articles on the history and theory of the game and drafts.</p>
<p>In 1884, the first in Russia “Charter of a Drafts Game” by the famous propagandist of drafts Mikhail Gonyayev (1849-1891), which officially canceled the “Fuk” rule, was published in the magazine “Rainbow” No. 15 and 16. This Charter has been guided by the organizers of many matches and tournaments, including the Russian Drafts Championships. The latest edition of this statute in pre-revolutionary Russia “The Charter of the game of Russian checkers” is contained in DI Sargin’s book The Antiquity of the Games of draughts and Chess, published in 1915.</p>
<p>From 1887 to 1889, the first drafts tournament in Russia was held by correspondence. The tournament was organized by the editor of the drafts department in the magazine “Picturesque Review” P. Plotitsin. The winners of the tournament were V. Saratov and P. Plotitsyn.</p>
<p>The first Russian drafts championship organized by Pavel Nikolaevich Bodyansky was held in Moscow in 1894. It was attended by 8 players, who played in two circles. The winners were two Muscovites &#8211; Sergei Vorontsov and Fyodor Kaulen. The following year, the second championship was held, also organized by Bodyansky, in which 14 participants played four laps among themselves. Vorontsov became the champion for the second time, Kaulen took 2nd place. In 1898, Bodyansky organized the third championship in Moscow, in which 12 participants played in four rounds. Kaulen became the champion (Vorontsov did not participate in the tournament.). In 1901, the fourth (the last before the revolution) Russian championship was held in Moscow, in which 15 participants played in two rounds. Vorontsov became the champion for the third time, A. Shoshin took 2nd place, Kaulen 3rd.</p>
<p>In 1897, the first periodical on drafts was published in Kiev &#8211; the monthly magazine draughts (edited by Pavel Bodyansky). The magazine existed for five years, during this time more than fifty issues were published. It printed games, reviews of tournaments, game theory, and checkers biographies.</p>
<p>Until 1917, the organization of the drafts movement was going on: tournaments were held by correspondence, face-to-face tournaments, including the Russian championship &#8211; the All-Russian checker tournament, draughts appeared, including periodicals.</p>
<h3>USSR</h3>
<p>In November 1922, the first championship of Moscow in Russian drafts was held, the winner of which was Vasily Medkov.</p>
<p>In 1924, the All-Union Chess and Drafts Section was created. The first championship of the USSR, which was attended by 20 checkers, was held in 1924. His winner was Vasily Medkov. Participants who scored at least 50% of points received the title of Master of Sports of the USSR.</p>
<p>In 1929, the 1st All-Union Small Championship with 66 participants was held in Moscow. In 1931, 84 players already took part in the 2nd small All-Union Championship.</p>
<p>In 1936, the first national championship in drafts among women was held in Leningrad, and 20 athletes took part in it. The victory was won by Catherine Sushchinskaya.</p>
<p>In 1937, the “United Drafts Code of the USSR” was issued, which contained the official text of the rules of a drafts game and drafts competitions, it contained rules and 100-draughts. Before the war, there were over 100 thousand checkers players in the country, including about 400 had a rank, over 40 were masters of sports.</p>
<p>In 1951, a decision was made to form, instead of a single All-Union chess and draughts section, two new separate structures: the USSR Checkers section and the USSR Chess Section.</p>
<p>In July 1959, the first issue of the magazine draughts was published in Riga. In the entire history of this publication (until mid-1992), 330 issues of the journal were published.</p>
<p>In 1956, the USSR Drafts Section joined the World Drafts Federation &#8211; FMJD.</p>
<p>In 1956, the first correspondence championship of the USSR was launched.</p>
<p>In 1959, the USSR Drafts Federation was created, which existed until 1992.</p>
<p>In 1960, new bit norms for Russian drafts were developed, and Iser Kuperman became the first drafts player to be awarded the title of Honored Master of Sports of the USSR. In 1961, the title of “Grandmaster of the USSR” was established for drafts. The first winner of this title was the multiple national champion Zinovy Tsirik.</p>
<p>Since 1966, the Wonder Drafts competition has been held annually among the pioneers under the auspices of the Komsomol Central Committee.</p>
<p>In 1972, the system of micro- matches were proposed for the first time, proposed by Moscow master Vladimir Gagarin, designed to increase the number of successful meetings. According to this system, the opponents had to determine the result of the meeting between them in one game, and in two: one game needed to be played by White, and the other by Black.</p>
<p>51 USSR championships among men and 35 championships among women were held.</p>
<h3>Russian Federation</h3>
<p>After the collapse of the USSR since 1992, Russian championships have been held. In 1995, the Russian Drafts Federation (FSHR) was created, which holds competitions in Russian drafts, along with international drafts. The rules of Russian, reverse Russian and international drafts are included in the “Rules of the sport » Checkers « , approved by order of the Ministry of Sports of Russia No. 722 of September 10, 2013.</p>
<h2>Comparison with other types of draughts</h2>
<p>The rules of the game of Russian checkers are similar to the rules of the game of international (100-check) draughts. The differences are in the size of the board, the number of checkers in the initial position, draughts notation, some rules of combat and recognition of endings as draws. A variety of Russian checkers are reverse Russian draughts (giveaway) and columnar checkers (or towers). According to the rules adopted in Russian draughts, they play double-pass and 80-cell checkers.</p>
<h2>Draughts Rules</h2>
<p>The checkerboard is positioned between partners in such a way that there is a dark corner field to the left of the player. In the initial position, each side has 12 pieces, which occupy the first three rows on each side. The game is played on dark fields. draughts are divided into simple and ladies. In the initial position, all the pieces are simple. When the last (eighth from you) horizontal row is reached, a simple piece turns into a queen. A queen is usually marked with either two pieces stacked on top of each other, or an upside-down piece.</p>
<h3>Rules of the course</h3>
<ul>
<li>A simple piece moves diagonally forward one square.</li>
<li>A lady goes diagonally to any free field both forward and backward.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules for taking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taking is required. Beaten pieces and queens are removed only after the completion of the move.</li>
<li>A simple piece, located next to the opponent&rsquo;s piece, behind which there is a free field, is transferred through this piece to this free field. If it is possible to continue taking other opponent&rsquo;s pieces, then this take continues until the striking piece reaches a position from which the fight is impossible. Taking a simple piece is made both forward and backward.</li>
<li>The lady beats diagonally, both forward and backward, and becomes on any free field after the beaten pieces. Likewise, a queen can beat several opponent pieces and must beat as long as possible.</li>
<li>When fighting through the ladies field, a simple piece turns into a lady and continues to fight according to the rules of the lady.</li>
<li>When taking the rule of Turkish strike is applied &#8211; in one move the opponent&rsquo;s sword can be beaten only once. That is, if during a fight of several opponent’s pieces, the piece or woman re-enters the already-beaten piece, then the movement stops.</li>
<li>With several options for taking, for example, one piece or two, the player chooses the option of taking at their discretion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game win</h3>
<p>A game is considered to be won in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>if one of the opponents has all the pieces;</li>
<li>if the pieces of one of the participants are locked and he cannot make another move;</li>
<li>if one of the participants announced that he is giving up;</li>
<li>if one of the participants has delayed the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>In tournaments, it is possible to lose for violating the rules for using control hours, for violating the rules for postponing a game and for not observing discipline.</p>
<h3>Draw</h3>
<p>A batch is considered a draw in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>if one of the participants offers a draw and the other accepts it;</li>
<li>if it is impossible to win any of the rivals;</li>
<li>if the same position is repeated three times;</li>
<li>if a participant who has three queens (and more) against one opponent&rsquo;s opponent, does not take the opponent&rsquo;s opponent in 15 moves;</li>
<li>if in the position in which both opponents have queens, the balance of forces has not changed (that is, there was no capture and no simple piece has become a lady) throughout:
<ul>
<li>in 2- and 3-figured endings &#8211; 5 moves,</li>
<li>in 4- and 5-figured endings &#8211; 30 moves,</li>
<li>in 6- and 7-figured endings &#8211; 60 moves;</li>
<li>if a participant, having at the end of the game three queens, two queens and a plain one, a lady and two simple, three plain versus a single lady who is on a high road, with his 5th move will not be able to achieve the winning position</li>
<li>if during 15 moves the players made moves only by the queens, without moving simple pieces and not taking a capture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Time control</h2>
<p>Section 64 of the FMJD offers the following options for controlling the time of the party at international competitions:</p>
<p>The competition was a classic draughts game:</p>
<ul>
<li>45 minutes for the first 25 moves plus 15 minutes for the rest of the game</li>
<li>1 hour per batch</li>
<li>1 hour per game plus 5 seconds for each move</li>
<li>45 minutes per game plus 30 seconds for each move</li>
<li>45 minutes plus 15 seconds per move</li>
<li>45 minutes plus 10 seconds for each move</li>
</ul>
<p>In the quick game competitions (Rapid):</p>
<ul>
<li>15 minutes per batch</li>
<li>10 minutes per batch</li>
<li>15 minutes plus 3 or 5 seconds for each move made until the end of the game</li>
<li>10 minutes plus 3 or 5 seconds for each move made until the end of the game</li>
</ul>
<p>In the lightning-fast game (blitz):</p>
<ul>
<li>3 minutes per batch</li>
<li>3 or 5 minutes plus 3 seconds for each move made until the end of the game</li>
<li>3 minutes plus 2 seconds for each move made until the end of the game</li>
</ul>
<h2>Draughts Competitions</h2>
<p>Initially, the World Drafts Federation FMJD was developed only by international drafts. For competitions on the small board (on the Russian and Brazilian versions of drafts, as well as checkers), a separate section was allocated in the World Drafts Federation &#8211; Section-64, which became involved in organizing individual and team world and European championships (men and women), as well as the World and European Youth Championships.</p>
<p>The first world championship in drafts-64 among men was held in 1985 in Brazilian drafts. Currently, the world championships are held in two versions &#8211; in one year in Russian drafts, in the other &#8211; Brazilian. These championships are held in three programs: the classic game, quick game, and blitz. Women&rsquo;s World Championships appeared in 1993. Since 2010, the World Cup is held among men. In some countries (Belarus, Israel, Lithuania, Latvia, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, Estonia) national championships are held. Since 2011, Russian championships in draughts are held (giveaway).</p>
<p>The unofficial world and European championships were held by the International Federation of Russian drafts MARSH, founded in 1992 by the federations of drafts in Russia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>Correspondence checkers do not develop officially; the championship is conducted by SLSHI (in chess, the International Federation of Chess Games by correspondence holds championships, although not under the auspices of FIDE, but officially recognized).</p>
<p>Major tournaments are held according to the Swiss system in several rounds. Each round is a micro-match of two games. For a victory in a micromachine, 2 points are given, for a draw 1, for a defeat 0. The place taken by the participant is determined by the number of points scored. In case of their equality, additional criteria are used, which are defined in the regulations of the official competitions of Section-64 of FMJD-IDF.</p>
<p>Recently, Russian drafts competitions are held in two ways: classic draughts and tournaments with a selective draw (with a draw for the initial moves and positions). In the second variant, before the beginning of each match, the first moves are determined by drawing lots, which must be made by the opponents. After the initial position has been established in this way, the opponents should continue the game. In the next game, the piece player, who played this position for white, plays it for black and vice versa. The result of the meeting of two drafts players is determined by the results of the games played in it. There is also an option “flying” checkers, in which one piece on each side occupies some other position in the initial position.</p>
<h3>World Championships</h3>
