<p>Czech draughts &#8211; one of the variants of the game of checkers, popular in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The goal of the game is to deprive the opponent of the possibility of a move by taking or locking all his pieces.</p>
<h2>Czech draughts Rules</h2>
<h3>Board and initial set up</h3>
<p>A board of 8 × 8 cells is located between partners in such a way that the lower left margin is black. In the initial position, each player has 12 pieces located in the first three rows on the black squares.</p>
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p>White draughts make the first move.<br />
« Simple » draughts can go diagonally one field forward.<br />
The lady goes to any number of cells forward and backward.</p>
<h3>Capture</h3>
<p>“Simple” checkers hit only forward. Taking the opponent&rsquo;s checkers is mandatory.<br />
The lady when taking is placed on any free field of the diagonal.<br />
If there are several options for taking the opponent&rsquo;s draughts, any of them is selected (there is no requirement to take the maximum number of draughts).<br />
If possible, take a simple checker and a lady, beating it with a lady.<br />
When taking the rule of Turkish strike is applied &#8211; in one move the opponent&rsquo;s sword can be beaten only once. That is, if during a fight of several opponent’s draughts, the piece or the queen re-enters the already beaten piece, then the movement stops.</p>
<h2>Notation</h2>
<p>To record moves, an alphanumeric notation similar to a chess set is used: horizontal rows are designated by numbers from 1 to 8, vertical rows are indicated by Latin letters from a to h. To record the progress of a simple checker or queen, first write down the field where the checker or queen stood, then put a dash and write down the field on which it is placed (for example f4-g5). When recording a capture (battle), a colon is inserted instead of a dash. The record f4: h6 means the move from the field f4 to h6 with the taking of checkers standing on the field g5, and f4: h6: f8: c5: g1 &#8211; the move with the taking of four pieces.</p>
<h2>Czech draughts Competitions</h2>
<p>According to Czech draughts held since 1998 Championships of the Czech Republic, as well as in the framework of the World Cup held stage, organized by the International Federation of draughts.</p>
