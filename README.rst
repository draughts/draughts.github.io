## How to play draughts?

The rules are simple:

- The pieces must always move one square at a time, on the black squares.
- The moves must be made diagonally only forward, except for a King. 
- To take an opponent's piece, you have to jump over it to an empty square. 
- Multi-takes are allowed and can be made by the same piece successively. 
- When a piece reaches the last opposing line of the board, it becomes King and can take backward.
- To win the game, you have to eat all your opponent's pieces or block them so they can not make any valid move.
