                                        Checkers, variant of Draughts (drafts), is by far one of the most played board games in the world after Chess. Its a fun and challenging two-players game for all ages with friends. You can play it as
                                        a beginner or expert, for free or for money, on a checkers-board or online against a computer and even on your android phone, iOS or iPad.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>Checkers rules (online / offline)</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Checkers is an online or offline board game played by 2 persons, each one on a side. One of them with the dark pieces, and the other with the light ones. Opponents, in alternate turns, should not
                                        touch his opponent’s pieces. All the moves must be made with one piece in the diagonal dark empty squares. A jump can be made only if the opponent’s piece is in an adjacent filed, with the one
                                        immediately beyond is unoccupied. Once this piece is jumped (over it), it must be removed from the gameboard.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The players is not free to move or jump on all the game-board’s squares, only the dark ones are used. If a square, in a diagonal line, is empty you are free to move to it. If you valid capturing
                                        possibility, you must take it because in most official rules (except some of them) capturing is obligatory.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Purpose of the game</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        To play and win a checkers game, in most of the variants, the player must capture all his opponent’s pieces and remove them from the board. Or he must block them and prevent his enemy to make any
                                        valid move or capture. And the player with all his pieces being eaten or are being blocked and is not free to make a move, loses.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Simple pieces</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        A simple piece (men, also called pawn or stone) move only one square forward in diagonal lines, and capture any of the opponent’s pieces by jumping to the empty square beyond it. A simple piece can
                                        make multi-jumps in one turn. A capture in a multi-jumps way is possible when finishing a simple capture you have another possible valid capture, then you can continue jumping. These captures can be
                                        done in the same line or in zigzag.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Kings</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        When a simple piece lands on a square in the last row starting from your side of the board, it becomes a king. A king is differentiated from a simple piece by placing an another simple piece on top of
                                        it. It acquires, then, more power with the ability to make backwards moves and captures. It’s also free to make multi-jumps, the same way as simple pieces.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In other game variants like international draughts, a king can make a flying move any distance in a line of unoccupied squares, always diagonally. It can do so to capture an opponent piece by flying
                                        to any empty fields next to it. The captured pieces cannot be removed from the checkers-board until finishing the player’s turn.
                                    </p>
                                    <h2>How to play Checkers online / with friends</h2>

                                        through the black squares of a board of 64 or 100 squares with the intention of capturing (eating).

                                        Fédération Mondiale du Jeu de Dames. In this variant, the each player has 20 stone on a 10 × 10 board.

                                    <h2>Checkers instructions and strategies</h2>

                                        are set in the black fields of the first 3 rows. The player with the clear (white) chips stats the fist move, then the other player and so on, alternately. To win the game, you have to capture or
                                        block the opponent’s pieces so that your enemy can not make any move.

                                    <h2>Checkers against the computer (online / offline)</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        The first program that the human has developed to play checkers against the computer is “Chinook”. It is a computer program that plays English checkers. It was developed between 1989 and 2007 at the
                                        University of Alberta, by a team led by Jonathan Schaeffer and including Rob Lake, Paul Lu, Martin Bryant, and Norman Treloar. In 2007, he proved that the game necessarily ends in a draw between two
                                        perfect players.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Chinook’s gaming algorithm provides a repository of openings, made of moves played at the beginning of grandmaster games; an algorithm for exploring deep variants; a move quality evaluation function;
                                        and an end position database of all positions with eight pieces or less. The evaluation function, which is manually optimized, is a linear combination of multiple position variables, such as the count
                                        of pieces and queens, the availability of unsecured promotion ways, or the locking of certain pieces. All of Chinook’s learning has been developed by its founders, not through artificial intelligence
                                        tools.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Chinook is the first computer software to have taken the world championship title in a strategy game competition versus human players. In 1990, it gained the right to compete in the (human) world
                                        championship by finishing second after Marion Tinsley in the U.S. national championship. The English checker federations were at first opposed to the involvement of a computer in human competitions,
                                        but when Tinsley gave up his title in protest, the ACF and EDA created a new title, checkers against computer World Championship, and the match was played. Tinsley won it by four wins to two, with 33
                                        draws.
                                    </p>

                                        However, all moves must be in diagonal. It is played by two opponents with different colors generally black and white, one on each side. Most importantly, the pieces used are the king with other
                                        pieces called a stone, peón, pawn, men. On the other hand, the pawns that become kings will be called dames or ladies and will have the king’s power. Moreover, you can visit this page to learn more

                                        The draughts is a board game for two opponents. The game consists of moving the pieces diagonally through the black or white squares of a board of 64 or 100 squares with the intention of capturing
                                        (eating) the pieces of the opposing player passing over said pieces.

                                        There are several modalities, with different boards and number of pieces. The international version, also called « Polish draughts », is regulated by the Fédération Mondiale du Jeu de Dames ( FMJD )
                                        and is played on a 10 × 10 board with two players with 20 pieces each. The normal pieces move 1 square vertically and if the edge is reached in the area of the enemy the piece will become a queen,
                                        which can be moved diagonally to any side the frames you want.

                                    <p>The draughts is a game for two people in a board of 64 squares of 8×8 cells. The board is placed so that each player has a white square in its lower right.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Each player has 12 pieces of the same color (one white and one black) that at the beginning of the game are placed in the black squares of the three rows closest to him. The objective of the checkers
                                        game is to capture the opponent’s chips or corner them so that the only moves they can make are those that lead to their capture.

                                    <p>It is played alternately. Start playing who has the clear (white) chips. On his turn, each player moves a piece of his own.</p>
                                    <p>The pieces move (when they do not eat) a forward position (never backward) diagonally to the right or to the left, to an adjacent empty position.</p>

                                    <p>A game of checkers ends when we are in one of these 3 situations:</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Loses who runs out of pieces on the board.<br />
                                        If the player makes a mistake 3 times, he loses.

                                    <p>
                                        If, when a player’s turn comes, he can not move, since all the pieces remaining in the game are blocked, before this there are three rules depending on the style practiced:<br />
                                        Boards.<br />
                                        Loses who owns the next movement.<br />
                                        Win who has more pieces, the same number of pieces wins who have more queens/ladies and if the match is also tied in tables.

                                        The player who has very few pieces can withdraw from the game.<br />
                                        The game can also end in tables if both players are left with a very small number of pieces so that by many moves that are made the game would not be resolved. The lady/queen always has priority to
                                        eat before any other card. Also, the lady moves only one frame after each capture. A normal piece can capture the lady.

                                        On July 20, 2007, in an article published in the journal Science, 2 the mathematical resolution for the checkers game was found, with the result that of tables. That is, if both opponents always play
                                        the perfect game based on the complete and perfect analysis, the tables are guaranteed.

                                        finally resolved the development of the game towards a draw. Inescapably.

                                        it has possibility on different sides the player must choose where to eat the case of the non-chosen side should be removed the tab not food).<br />
                                        Before two capture options, it is not necessary to choose the one that captures more pieces, or of more range. Yes, if we start a capture and can continue, we have to do it.<br />
                                        If a player can not move, he has lost.

                                        Not like Czech draughts and with the board in the same position, the pieces go in the white squares. They can only kill diagonally for back and forth is called multiple movements<br />
                                        If a player can not move, he has lost.<br />
                                        At the official level, it is not blown (if a movement is made instead of eating, one of the chips that can be eaten is not removed).<br />
                                        The Checkers Game is developed on a board of 64 squares (8×8), colored white and black alternately (classic board) with the white lower right slot.<br />
                                        The board must be flat and not shiny surface, divided into eight equal parts in height and width (8×8) whose intersections give rise to the 64 squares of the board.<br />
                                        The pieces, called pawns, may be made of wood, plastic, bone or ivory, 12 for each side, white and black.<br />
                                        You play on the white squares of the board, leaving the large diagonal or main diagonal to the right of the player (lower right corner of the board).<br />
                                        The board is numbered in the following way: It is counted always from top to bottom and from left to right and only the white squares are numbered. Thus the first white square in the first row will be
                                        number 1 and the last white square in the last row will be number 32. This numbering will be the one used for the representation of items, positions, studies and in general everything related to the
                                        game nomenclature.<br />
                                        The 12 white pawns are placed on squares 1 to 12 of the board and the 12 black pawns on squares 21 to 32.<br />
                                        Each color is driven by a player. The first move must always be made by the player with the white chips.<br />
                                        The movements of the pawns are diagonal, one square and in the forward direction, that is, towards the opposing field.<br />
                                        The movements are made alternately, one per player.<br />
                                        « Piece played, the piece played ». If a piece is played, it must be played if the movement is possible.<br />
                                        If a pawn reaches the opponent’s baseline (1-4 white, 29-32 black), it becomes a queen, crowning it with another pawn.<br />
                                        The lady also moves diagonally, but back and forth, being able to go through any number of squares if they are free.<br />
                                        The lady can not jump two pawns together or a pawn of her color. In case of a pawn of another color see the capture of pieces.<br />
                                        If a pawn is in a diagonal square next to another of the opponent, the back one being empty and in turn, he can jump over it to the empty square, removing him from the board.<br />
                                        If after a jump, the pawn reaches a square in the same conditions as the previous one, it can continue jumping and so on as many times as this is possible (multiple captures).<br />
                                        If a lady is in turn and on the same diagonal with an opposite piece behind which there are empty squares, she can jump this until she is in any of the empty squares.<br />
                                        If after making the previous jump you find another diagonal with another piece in the same conditions, you can continue the jumps as many times as this is possible (multiple captures).<br />
                                        In multiple captures, on the same diagonal you can jump twice over the same piece.<br />
                                        A capture movement does not end until all possible jumps are completed. Only then can the captured pieces be removed from the board.<br />
                                        Capturing is absolutely mandatory. If a player has not noticed a capture, he should be warned.<br />
                                        In case of competition, if a game is shown that after a certain movement the rules have been violated, it must be repeated from the infringing or annulled movement, as agreed by the jury appointed for
                                        that purpose.<br />
                                        Law of Quantity: It is mandatory to capture as many pieces as possible.<br />
                                        Law of the Quality: To the equal number of pieces to capture, it is obligatory to capture to those of greater quality, lady before pawn.<br />
                                        A game is considered lost when a player: He loses all his pieces.<br />
                                        It has pieces, but touching it has no possible movement (c).<br />

                                        the opposing pawn.<br />
                                        In competition, any dispute or controversy over the application of these rules will be resolved by the jury appointed for that purpose. Example of the Law of Quality: the black pawn must eat the white
                                        pawn and queen, instead of the 2 white pawns

                                        This is a peculiar variant of the draughts, played between 2, 4 or 6 players, each with a different color. The board is also squared (in the case of playing 6 players the board is hexagonal) but with
                                        many more squares.

                                        The movement of the pieces is the following: in each turn, the player moves a single piece, either by moving the piece towards an empty adjacent square, or by jumping on other pieces, either his or
                                        another player’s. The jump can be done as long as the final square where the piece is going is empty, and just like conventional draughts, multiple jumps can be made. In this game, pieces are not
                                        eaten, they simply move by jumping over each other, it is interesting to make movements of several jumps, as the pieces arrive before the opposite vertex.
