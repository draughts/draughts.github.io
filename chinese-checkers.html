<p>The Chinese checkers is a board game being played on a deck (match) generally circular or hexagonal, in which a six-pointed star is shown, having 121 holes in total.</p>
<p>The pawns are arranged in the six outer triangles of a six-pointed star, forming six groups of ten pawns, and making it possible to play two, three, four, or six players at a time. Each group has a different color. With two or three players, you can play with groups of fifteen pawns.</p>
<p>Each pawn is always on a slot, and a slot is occupied only by a pawn.</p>
<p>Depending on the material used, the pieces may be balls, and the locations are then materialized by holes in the game board. Alternatively, the game directions are drawn on deck, and the locations are the intersections of these lines. The pieces are placed on these intersections.</p>
<h2>Chinese checkers History</h2>
<p>A game of Hop Ching checkers, Montreal, July 1942<br />
Despite their name, the Chinese checkers are not of Chinese origin. In 1883, the American George Howard Monks invents a game named Halma. The name is derived from the ancient Greek ἅλμα, which means « jump » and is also the name of one of the five events of the ancient pentathlon. This initial version of the game is played on a grid of squares forming a square in 16 × 16. In 1892, a variant of the game, played on squares arranged in a star, is patented and marketed by the German company Ravensburger under the name of Stern-Halma(« Halma star »). It was not until 1928 that the term « Chinese Checkers » was used for the first time when the game was marketed under the name of Hop Ching in the United States by the company. J. Pressman &amp; Co. The game in its square or star form is still called Halma in many countries 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the game</h2>
<p>The goal of the game is to move all of his pieces in the area opposite to his starting area. The winner is the first player to bring all his pieces to his finish area.</p>
<h2>Chinese checkers Rules</h2>
<p>The players are symmetrically distributed around the deck of the game.</p>
<p>Each controls a group of ten or fifteen pieces, which must be brought into the symmetrical zone of its starting zone with respect to the center of the deck.</p>
<p>In the case of the three-player game, this zone is free from the beginning of the game.<br />
In other cases (two, four, or six players game), it is occupied at the beginning of the game by an opposing player, who will release it as and when it progresses.<br />
Each plays, in turn, a single pawn. A movement takes place according to two modes, to choose and exclusively:</p>
<p>Moving a box in one of the six directions of the board.<br />
Movement by successive jumps (during a single turn). Each jump is made above a piece of any color, symmetrically with respect to this piece, and in one of the directions of the board. The basic rule is that the pawn over which one jumps must be directly adjacent, a variant frequently played by the professionals authorizes the « long jumps ». In all cases, the jump may only be allowed if no other pieces are in the jump path or in the finish square, except for the pin that serves as a pivot.<br />
Unlike the classic checkers, the jump is made without taking. The pieces remain in play throughout the game.</p>
<p>Finally, additional rules prevent the blocking of the game:</p>
<p>A pawn has the right to stay only in its starting triangle, in the central hexagon or in its arrival triangle. During a course, you have the right to go through a wing triangle, but not to park there.<br />
A pawn must obligatorily leave his starting triangle when the player located vis-a-vis has more, as only stroke allowing him to progress, that the re-entry: we must then leave the place free, even if we have a better other blow (it is forbidden to block another player).</p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>It is, of course, crucial to use the pawns of other players to progress as quickly as possible. It is also important not to leave a pawn on the side because at the end of the game the center of the star often deserts and the remaining pawns no longer have the opportunity to make jumps and find themselves forced to advance box per box.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the relationship with the opponent directly opposed is particular because of the mutual dependence that is created: the two players need to occupy the place freed by the other, and their strategy influences more on this adversary than on the other.</p>
<h2>Variant</h2>
<p>You can speed up the pace of a game by allowing successive jumps with as many free slots before and after the piece above which you jump.</p>
<h2>Computer Version</h2>
<p>There are several software of this game.</p>
<p>The arrival of tablets with touch screens now offers a real comfort of play: players can take place around the tablet in place of the apron. If players are missing the machine can play in their place.</p>
